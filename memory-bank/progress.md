- Multi-provider support: ✅ Complete
- Error handling: ✅ Robust with hard failures
- Git integration: ✅ Working
- Pre-commit integration: ✅ Working
- CLI interface: ✅ Full argument support

## What Works Well

### Core Features
- Semantic document merging with AI
- Support for `.md`, `.rst`, `.txt`, `.adoc`, `.asciidoc` files
- Async processing for performance
- Git operations for branch comparison
- Type-safe implementation

### Multi-Provider Support
- Automatic provider detection based on API keys
- Support for both OpenAI and DeepSeek
- Model override capabilities
- Clear error messages for configuration issues

### Development Experience
- Modern Python tooling (uv, ruff, pyrefly, Taskfile)
- Comprehensive test suite with integration tests
- Proper exception handling patterns
- Memory bank documentation system

### Production Features
- Pre-commit hook integration
- Fail-safe operation (hard failure mode)
- Clear documentation and examples
- GitHub release process

## Ready for Next Phase

**v1.1.0 Release Readiness:**
The codebase is complete and ready for the v1.1.0 release. All functionality has been implemented, tested, and documented. The project can proceed to:

1. **Git Commit & Tag**: Create commit and tag for v1.1.0
2. **GitHub Release**: Push to GitHub for public availability
3. **Optional PyPI**: Publish to PyPI if desired

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Additional AI providers (Anthropic Claude, etc.)
- Configuration file support
- Custom prompt templates
- Enhanced file type support
- Performance optimizations

## Breaking Changes Implemented

**From v1.0.x to v1.1.0:**
- Hard failure mode (no graceful degradation)
- New SemanticMerger constructor signature
- New command-line argument structure
- Updated default models

All breaking changes are documented and the migration path is clear for users.

## Technical Debt: Minimal

The codebase follows modern Python practices with:
- Proper type hints throughout
- Exception chaining patterns
- Strategic use of `# type: ignore` comments
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling

No significant technical debt has been identified.
