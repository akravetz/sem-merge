# Product Context: sem-merge

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Development teams often face challenges when merging documentation files:
- **Conflicting Changes**: Multiple team members modify the same documentation simultaneously
- **Manual Merge Conflicts**: Git's line-based merging doesn't understand document semantics
- **Information Loss**: Important content from both versions can be lost during manual resolution
- **Workflow Disruption**: Complex merge conflicts slow down development velocity

### Solution Approach
sem-merge solves this by providing AI-powered semantic understanding of documentation changes:
- **Intelligent Merging**: Understands document structure and content meaning
- **Automated Resolution**: Reduces manual merge conflict resolution
- **Content Preservation**: Ensures no important information is lost
- **Seamless Integration**: Works automatically within existing git workflows

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### For Developers
1. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box once added to pre-commit config
2. **Transparent Operation**: Runs automatically without user intervention
3. **Fail-safe Behavior**: Never blocks commits or disrupts workflow
4. **Informative Feedback**: Clear messages about what was merged

#### For Teams
1. **Consistent Documentation**: Maintains uniform structure across all contributions
2. **Collaborative Workflow**: Reduces friction when multiple people edit docs
3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures merged content meets documentation standards
4. **Historical Tracking**: All merges are tracked in git history

### Workflow Integration

#### Standard Workflow
```bash
# Developer makes documentation changes
echo "New content" >> README.md

# Stages and commits as normal
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update documentation"

# sem-merge automatically:
# 1. Detects README.md was modified
# 2. Fetches version from remote main
# 3. Semantically merges the content
# 4. Updates staged file
# 5. Allows commit to proceed

# Output: "Semantically merged 1/1 files"
```

#### Configuration Flexibility
```yaml
# Basic usage
- id: semantic-merge
  files: \.(md|mdc)$

# Advanced configuration
- id: semantic-merge
  files: \.(md|mdc|rst)$
  exclude: ^(docs/generated/|node_modules/)
```

## Target Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Documentation Teams**: Multiple writers working on the same documents
2. **Open Source Projects**: Contributors from different backgrounds editing docs
3. **Technical Writing**: API documentation, user guides, developer documentation
4. **Knowledge Bases**: Wiki-style documentation with frequent updates

### Specific Scenarios
- **README Updates**: Multiple developers adding features and updating documentation
- **API Documentation**: Changes to endpoints and examples from different developers
- **User Guides**: Content updates from product and engineering teams
- **Changelog Maintenance**: Multiple features being documented simultaneously

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- **Merge Quality**: Merged content preserves all important information
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintains document formatting and organization
- **Performance**: Processes files quickly without blocking commits
- **Reliability**: Handles API failures gracefully

### User Success
- **Adoption Rate**: Teams continue using the tool after initial setup
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with existing processes
- **Time Savings**: Reduces time spent on manual merge conflict resolution
- **Content Quality**: Improved consistency and completeness of documentation
